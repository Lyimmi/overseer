> Simple process manager library.


The useful methods are:

* `NewOverseer()` - Returns a new instance of a process manager.
* To register processes, use the `Add(id string, args ...string)` method, and to unregister use the `Remove(id string)` method.
* `SuperviseAll()` - This is the main function. Supervise all processes and block until they finish. This includes killing all the processes when the main program exits.
* `Supervise(id string)` - Supervise one registered process and block until it finishes. This includes checking if the process was killed from the outside, delaying the start and restarting in case of failure.
* `Stop(id string)` - Stops the process by sending its process group a SIGTERM signal.
* `Signal(id string, sig syscall.Signal)` - Sends an OS signal to the process group.
* `StopAll()` - Cycles and stops all processes by sending SIGTERM.

Highlights:

* real-time stdout and stderr
* real-time status
* complete and consolidated return
* proper process termination on exit
* portable command line binary for managing procs
* heavily tested, good coverage
* no race conditions


For examples of usage, please check the tests, or the command line script (for now). The API is not fixed yet.
